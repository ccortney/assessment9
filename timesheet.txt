Part 3 (Snack or Booze): 
    1.5 hours getting the application working with react v6 (super annoying!)

    45 minutes revamping FoodMenu & FoodItem to be used for snacks and drinks
    2 hours creating a new suggestion form that posted to the api. 
    30 minutes creating a 404 Not Found page and redirects for invalid url parameters
    2+ hours (unsuccessfully) trying to figure out how to test the database and api calls when
        the server is not running.
